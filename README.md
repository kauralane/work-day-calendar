# Work Day Calendar
A scheduler for your work day (9am - 5pm)

## Description
This is a simple application deployed to a webpage which allows the user to input tasks on a scheduler-style table. The application makes use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I've also used jQuery, dayjs and bootstrap.

The user can click on the main body of the corresponding hour and input text. The user can then click the corresponding save button and the inputted task will save to local storage, and print to the page on refresh. 

The application also displays whether each hour (9am - 5pm) is in the past or future, or is the current hour. It does this via colour coding - grey is past, green is future, red is now.

## Installation
None - available for use via the deployed application link. 

## Usage
This is a simple webpage - the user simply needs to click on the box to the right of the selected hour, and they can input text directly. Clicking the save icon will then save the entry so that it reloads upon refreshing the page. The user can tell the hour in relation to the current time by looking at the colour coding - grey is past, green is future, red is now. 

## Credits
To my TA on the bootcamp course Kris for letting me know that you can compare dayjs with a string! 

And, as usual, to W3schools, geeksforgeeks.com, and MDN web docs.
