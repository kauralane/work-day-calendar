# Work Day Calendar
A scheduler for your work day (9am - 5pm)

## Description
This is a simple application deployed to a webpage which allows the user to input tasks on a scheduler-style table. The application makes use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I've also used jQuery and dayjs. 

The user can click on the main body of the corresponding hour and input text. The user can then click the corresponding save button and the inputted task will save to local storage, and print to the page on refresh. 

[Deployed application]()

## Installation
None - available for use via the deployed application link. 

## Usage
This is a simple webpage - the user simply needs to click on the box to the right of the selected hour, and they can input text directly. Clicking the save icon will then save the entry so that it reloads upon refreshing the page. 

## Credits
To my TA on the bootcamp course Kris for letting me know that you can compare dayjs with a string! 

And, as usual, to W3schools, geeksforgeeks.com, and MDN web docs.
